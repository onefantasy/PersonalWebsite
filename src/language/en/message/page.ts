  selfIntroduction:
    'My name is white bear and my age is XX years old. Home on this planet, unmarried. I learned the technology by myself on the Internet. During that time, I studied for at least 8 hours every day. I didn not play games or go out to play. I went to bed at 11 p.m. to ensure that I slept for 8 hours. Drink a cup of warm milk before going to bed, do 20 minutes of soothing exercise to warm up, and then go to bed. I can basically sleep until dawn without leaving any fatigue and pressure like a baby. In this way, I ushered in the morning of the next day. The health examination results also showed that I was very normal.',
